## Grant Discovery

### How Matching Works

GrantRadar's matching algorithm analyzes each grant opportunity against your organization's profile, considering:

- **Focus Area Alignment** — How well the grant's objectives match your mission
- **Eligibility Criteria** — Whether your organization type qualifies
- **Funding Range** — Alignment with your typical award sizes
- **Geographic Requirements** — Location-based eligibility
- **Historical Patterns** — Similar grants your organization has pursued

Each grant receives a match score from 0-100%, helping you prioritize the most promising opportunities.
